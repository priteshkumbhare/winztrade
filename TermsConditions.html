<p style="color:white;"><strong>About WinzTrade</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li style="color:white;"><p style="color:white;"><strong>Registration and Authentication:</strong> To gain access
to WinzTrade, users must commence their journey by registering through
their mobile phone number, with authentication achieved through a
One-Time Password (OTP). Upon successful registration, users will be
welcomed to the platform with an informative overview of WinzTrade.
Users have the liberty to customize their Display Name, optionally,
input a Referral Code, and compulsorily select their State of Residence.
As a token of our appreciation, users will receive a Welcome Bonus of
₹10, along with a Referral Bonus, also of ₹10, if applicable.
Post-registration, users are strongly advised to provide their Email
Address.<br />
When entering the State of Residence, if the participant selects any of
Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Nagaland, Odisha, Sikkim and Telangana, they will
not be allowed to proceed with signing up.</p></li>
<li style="color:white;"><p style="color:white;"><strong>Competitions:</strong> WinzTrade orchestrates a diverse
array of competitions, each thoughtfully categorized to align with
specific subjects encompasing cricket, stocks, and movies. Users will
find an inventory of live competitions for each category on the
application's home page. Each competition presents a forecast-based
question with a pair of distinct mutually exclusive and most of the
time, exhaustive options, and users are tasked to research independently
or via our reading material that in turn should help predict the correct
answer. Each option has certain price associated with it which is
dynamically adjusted based on that option’s demand. This price is
charged in order to enter a competition. Users are highly encouraged to
conduct thorough research by leveraging the provided reading materials,
doing an in-depth analysis, reading news articles, and expert opinions
before choosing any option. Users are also recommended to go through the
Tips page under Rules &amp; Tips section on the sidebar of home
page.</p></li>
<li style="color:white;"><p style="color:white;"><strong>Prediction and Orders:</strong> Users select their
favoured option, determine the order quantity (which is pivotal in
shaping potential earnings and associated risk), and subsequently
confirm their selection with a swipe on the swipeable button. The
default quantity is set at 1, offering a chance to earn ₹10 if the
prediction is accurate.<br />
Support you buy Q quantities of certain option at a total price of ₹P,
if your prediction is accurate, you will earn ₹10 x Q, else 0. Hence
potential profit = (₹10 x Q) – P and potential loss = ₹P. Consider an
example: “With respect to India's GDP Growth Rate last quarter, where
will the upcoming GDP Growth Rate stand?” having 2 options: Increase and
Decrease. You research and decide that the answer is Increase and you
choose to buy its 3 quantities at Total Price of ₹18.00 i.e., Avg. Price
of ₹6.00. After the declaration of GDP growth result, if it increases,
you get 3 x ₹10.00 = ₹30.00 hence profit = ₹30 – ₹18 = ₹12. If you’d
have chosen decrease at same price, you would have lost the entry fees
hence incurring a loss of ₹18.<br />
Users are also afforded the flexibility to place multiple orders for a
single competition, possibly catering to different options at different
times till the contest is live. The ultimate outcome of each contest
governs the distribution of earnings or losses, and they are
meticulously detailed for each of your orders in each of the
participated competitions under the 'My Contests' section in the
'Completed' category. Note that the decision of WinzTrade on competition
winnings shall be final and indisputable.</p></li>

<li style="color:white;"><p style="color:white;"><strong>About Us:</strong> Offering an overview of WinzTrade, its
mission, and core values.</p></li>
<li style="color:white;"><p style="color:white;"><strong>Terms and Conditions:</strong> Elaborating on the

platform.</p></li>
<li style="color:white;"><p style="color:white;"><strong>Legality:</strong> Clarifying the legal framework
underpinning WinzTrade's operations.</p></li>
<li style="color:white;"><p style="color:white;"><strong>Privacy Policy:</strong> Detailing our approach to
privacy and data protection.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li style="color:white;"><p style="color:white;"><strong>WinzTrade Wallet</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li style="color:white;"><p style="color:white;">The Wallet page acts as the app’s financial nerve centre,
offering insights into users' financial activities pertaining to
WinzTrade. Here, users can monitor their Wallet Balance and scrutinize
the intricacies of Recent Transactions, which are methodically
categorized into two primary types: Credit (pertaining to money inflow)
and Debit (relating to money outflow).</p></li>
<li style="color:white;"><p style="color:white;">In recognition of the separation of funds, WinzTrade keeps
Deposited Balance and Earning Balance distinct. Consequently, the Total
Wallet Balance is computed as the sum of Deposited Balance and Earning
Balance.</p></li>
<li style="color:white;"><p style="color:white;">Transactions, such as Welcome Bonuses, Deposits from bank,
Referral Bonuses, and Suggestion Bonuses, contribute to the Deposited
Balance. Meanwhile, Competition Earnings are methodically attributed to
the Earning Balance.</p></li>
<li style="color:white;"><p style="color:white;">Transaction-related debits from the Wallet Balance encompass
"Competition Participation Fees" i.e., price to choose an option, which
are initially deducted from the Deposited Balance. In cases where
Deposited Balance proves insufficient, the Debit is subsequently sourced
from the Earning Balance.</p></li>
<li style="color:white;"><p style="color:white;">In the realm of financial transactions, a third category of
transactions known as "Failed Transactions" makes its presence felt.
These transactions arise due to various reasons, such as payment
failures triggered by banking issues or insufficient bank account
balances. While these transactions feature within the ambit of Recent
Transactions, they remain neutral and do not exert any influence over
the Wallet Balance as no real transaction has been successfully
made.</p></li>
<li style="color:white;"><p style="color:white;">Users are expected to log out of their accounts at the conclusion
of each session. WinzTrade holds no liability for any losses or damages
that may occur should the User not adhere to these stipulations for face
a loss in any of the competitions.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li style="color:white;"><p style="color:white;"><strong>Transactions</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li style="color:white;"><p style="color:white;"><strong>Adding Balance:</strong> WinzTrade facilitates the
augmentation of Wallet Balance by empowering users to deposit funds from
their bank accounts. This can be accomplished through a seamless process
that involves any of your installed UPI apps. Lower limit of ₹1 is
imposed on the deposited amount, although an upper limit of ₹10,000 is
instituted to mitigate User’s financial risks.</p></li>
<li style="color:white;"><p style="color:white;"><strong>Withdrawal to Bank Account:</strong> The platform extends
an avenue for users to transfer their winnings to their bank accounts
via withdrawals. A minimum withdrawal amount limit of ₹50 is enforced,
with users initially (and once) requiring to provide essential Bank
Details, including the Account Owner's Name, Account Number, and IFSC
Code. Users are also required to get their account verified to submit
withdrawal requests. The submission and verification of this information
ensures secure and expedited transactions. Users can anticipate the
arrival of withdrawn funds within their bank accounts within a timeframe
of 3 days. If a user is found to be a resident of any of the states
among Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Nagaland, Odisha, Sikkim and Telangana,
WinzTrade can discontinue or delete the account of the User and freeze
his/her winnings from withdrawal. Also, if the User is found to be under
the age of 18, WinzTrade will be entitled to discontinue/deactivate the
account and freeze the winnings from withdrawal. WinzTrade doesn’t
charge any withdrawal fees.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p style="color:white;"><strong>Legality</strong></p>
<p style="color:white;">Game of Skill are legal in India, as they are not governed by and
excluded from the Public Gambling Act of 1867. The Indian Supreme Court
has ruled that a game in which success depends mainly on the player’s
intellectual knowledge, training, attention, experience, and adroitness
is classified as a game of skill. This ruling was made in the cases of
<a href="https://main.sci.gov.in/jonew/judis/2226.pdf">State of Andhra
Pradesh v. K Satyanarayana</a> and <a
href="https://main.sci.gov.in/judgment/judis/16203.pdf">KR Lakshmanan v.
State of Tamil Nadu</a>. The competitions held on WinzTrade are purely
game of skill as success/failure of Users depend primarily on their
research and knowledge of concerned category and question. By
registering and taking participating in the competition, the User agrees
that he/she is participating in a game of skill.</p>
